# Components

Components are re-usable parts of the user interface. They are named chunks of code that have been made to support a variety of applications. They are often associated with specific patterns when used in a particular context.
On the most part, if you are using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit or have GOV.UK Frontend included in your build, the coded examples provided should render exactly as they do inside the design system.
Some larger components, such as Autocomplete may have their own GitHub repository which will need to be included in your build separately.
